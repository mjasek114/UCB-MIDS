Below is a list of some of the hospitals that were output by 9 measures that I chose to 
look at.  Unfortunately, my SQL skills are not honed enough at this point for me
to do a more complex analysis even though I wanted to.  What I did was choose 9
representative measures (AMI_10, AMI_7A, OP_21, HF_2, IMM_2, OP_23, PN_6, STK_1,
and VTE_1) and found some of the hospitals with the top scores for these measures
and created a table listing them.  The query that I used was below.

result = sqlContext.sql('SELECT CAST(SCORE AS INT) AS A1, PROVIDERID FROM  \
hospital_procedure WHERE MEASUREID="AMI_10" ORDER BY A1 DESC LIMIT 20')
result.show()

I could not get the STDDEV funtion to work in the below query so I do not have variabilty data.

result = sqlContext.sql('SELECT COUNT(SCORE), AVG(CAST(SCORE AS INT)), STDDEV(CAST(SCORE AS INT)), \
MAX(CAST(SCORE AS INT)) AS A1, MEASURENAME FROM hospital_procedure GROUP BY MEASURENAME \
ORDER BY A1 DESC LIMIT 10')

This is the query without STDDEV.
