Here are some average scores for patient survey responses.  I added the HBASESCORE
and HCONSISTSCORE because together those form the complete patient response.  The
highest possible score is 100.0 and it looks like many hospitals have achieved that
max score.  So I would say that 'no', scores for hospital quality do not
correlate to patient survey responses.

result = sqlContext.sql('SELECT COUNT(HBASESCORE), AVG(CAST(HBASESCORE AS INT)+CAST(HCONSISTSCORE AS INT)) AS A1, HOSPITALNAME FROM surveys_responses GROUP BY HOSPITALNAME ORDER BY A1 DESC LIMIT 20')
