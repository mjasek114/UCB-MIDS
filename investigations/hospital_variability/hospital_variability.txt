I was not able to find which procedures had the greatest variability between
hospitals because my STDDEV SQL function was not working.  AVG worked but
STDDEV was not working.  Had that been working then the below query
would have yielded the procedures with the most variability.  And if
my SQL skills would have been better I would have normalized the data
by dividing each of the procedure scores by its maximum.  I also would 
have accounted for the fact that for some procedures a high score was
good and for some procedures a high score was bad.  I could have done this
by multiplying the scores for the procedures where high was bad by -1 
and the using the absolute value of the average.


result = sqlContext.sql('SELECT COUNT(SCORE), AVG(CAST(SCORE AS INT)), STDDEV(CAST(SCORE AS INT)) AS A1, MEASURENAME FROM hospital_procedure GROUP BY MEASURENAME ORDER BY A1 DESC LIMIT 10')
